## Background

I wanted to explore if computer vision and machine learning techniques can be used to distinguish between images of dunks and jumpshots. If so, videos could hypotheticall be classfied as well since they are simply a sequence of images. These methods could assist in automated box score statistic recording, shot chart tracking, and beyond.

## Objectives

* Classify images as a dunk or jumpshot in:
⋅⋅* Photos from Google Images
⋅⋅* Frames extracted from clips from the broadcast camera angle<
* Identify the unique challenges of differentiating between a dunk and jumpshot for each of these types of images.
* Classify a highlight clip by taking the majority classification prediction of its individual frames
